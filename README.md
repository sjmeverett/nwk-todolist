I'm using this project to learn about a bunch of things:
* [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit)
* [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)
* [Ractive](http://www.ractivejs.org/)
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

It is main part is written in literate CoffeeScript, and found in the [coffee](coffee) directory.  It
roughly follows a sort of MVP pattern, where the domain model is the [TodoList class](coffee/todolist.litcoffee)
and the presenter is in [presenter.litcoffee](coffee/presenter.litcoffee).
