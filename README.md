I'm using this project to learn about a bunch of things:
* [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit)
* [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/)
* [Ractive](http://www.ractivejs.org/)
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

It is main code is the [coffee](coffee) directory; it's written in literate CoffeeScript so clicking the
lines below will give more information.  It roughly follows a sort of MVP pattern, where the domain model
is the [TodoList class](coffee/todolist.litcoffee) and the presenter is in
[presenter.litcoffee](coffee/presenter.litcoffee).
